SQL Homework

For this lab, we will use sqlite3, it is already available on your machine using the command sqlite3, copy the file sql_dump.sql in a folder where your sqlite3 database will be, then type:

sqlite3 wishlists.db < sql_dump.sql
This will create the database wishlists. Unlike Postgres, sqlite3 create a file in the folder where you are, if you delete this file, you delete the db !

To connect to the database, type sqlite3 wishlists.db, then you can execute sql statements.

Write SQL statements that:

1. Selects the names of all products that are not on sale.

- select name from products where on_sale = 'f';

2. Selects the names of all products that cost less than £20.

-  select name from products where price < 20;

3. Selects the name and price of the most expensive product.

- select MAX(price), name from products;

4. Selects the name and price of the second most expensive product.

-

5. Selects the name and price of the least expensive product.

- select MIN(price), name from products;

6. Selects the names and prices of all products, ordered by price in descending order.

- select name, price from products order by price DESC;

7. Selects the average price of all products.

- select AVG(price) from products;

8. Selects the sum of the price of all products.

- select SUM(price) from products;

9. Selects the sum of the price of all products whose prices is less than £20.

- select SUM(price) from products where price < 20;

10. Selects the id of the user with your name.

- select id from users where name = 'ALex Chin';

11. Selects the names of all users whose names start with the letter "J".

- select name from users where name LIKE 'J%';

12. Selects the number of users whose first names are "Spencer".

- sqlite> select count(*) from users where name LIKE 'Spencer%';

13. Selects the number of users who want a "Teddy Bear".

- select count(*) from users where id in (select user_id from wishlists where product_id = 1);

14. Selects the count of items on the wishlish of the user with your name.

- select count(*) from wishlists where id in (select id from users where name = 'ALex Chin');

15. Selects the count and name of all products on the wishlist, ordered by count in descending order.

-

16. Selects the count and name of all products that are not on sale on the wishlist, ordered by count in descending order.

-

17. Inserts a user with the name "Jonathan Anderson" into the users table. Ensure the created_at column is set to the current time.

- insert into users (created_at, name) values (CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, 'Jonathan Anderson');

18. Selects the id of the user with the name "Jonathan Anderson"?

- select id from users where name = 'Jonathan Anderson';

19. Inserts a wishlist entry for the user with the name "Jonathan Anderson" for the product "The Ruby Programming Language".

- insert into wishlists (created_at, user_id, product_id) values (CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, 15, 4);

20. Updates the name of the "Jonathan Anderson" user to be "Jon Anderson".

- update users set name = 'Jon Anderson' where name = 'Jonathan Anderson';

21. Deletes the user with the name "Jon Anderson".

-	delete from users where name = 'Jon Anderson';

22. Deletes the wishlist item for the user you just deleted.
